# DarkSkyForecast

This is a toy application which displays weather forecast (summary, minimum and maximum temeprature) for the next five days based on the location entered. 
I have used DarkSky api to get the weather forecast based on latitude and longitude of the region. 
Mapquest API has been used to fetch the latitude and longitude of the location and response is then passed to darksky api.

# ServiceStack
ServiceStack is a configuration free, code-first, light-weight framework built on top of ASP.NET for building services and web applications. I have used it in my last project and thought it would be a nice practice for me. I have self hosted the application using Servicestack.

# KnockoutJS
KnockoutJS is a model view view model(MVVM) based Javascript library which helps to implement dynamic UI's very easily. It uses observers to make the UI stay in sync with an underlying data model.
